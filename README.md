# Wave Function Collapse in Processing

This is an implementation of the tiles mode of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, made in processing. It isn't really designed to be used in other projects, it's just a stand-alone test. You can find more information about the algorithm this is based on here: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse



Here is an example of a generated circuit board:
